PixCount is an Android-native Kotlin mobile app for creating customizable year-overviews.
Define color-coded categories for any list, then assign one category per day to make a simple year-overview of your habits and activities.

Multiplatform version with slightly fewer features: [PixLists](https://github.com/Gathok/PixLists)
